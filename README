Taggart is a proof-of-concept to "decorate" strings with HTML tags.
===================================================================
Background:
It's not particularly nice to write "<strong>#{my_variable}</strong>" when
One could simply write my_variable.strong. The more complex the Ruby code
is, the nicer it is to not have ", #, { or } soiling the code.


Playtime:
  Install the gem:
    gem install taggart
  Then load Taggart with:
    require 'taggart'
  Taggart is now active, which means you can play around.
  Try: 
    "Hello World".h1
  Or (typographically bad taste): 
    "Important".em.strong
  Or do some proper nesting:
    ("Label".td + "Value".td)._tr.table
  Add attributes
    "hello".span(class: 'stuff', id: 'thing')
  How about a table using arrays?:
     (%w(r1c1 r1c2 r1c3).td.tr + %w(r2c1 r2c2 r2c3).td.tr).table
  We can also do single tags.
     "Gimme a".br

Issues:
 - "hello"._sub('world', 'world') returns 
      "<sub  world  world>hello</sub>"
     Not really perfect

Future??? (with your blessing)
 - Package it into a gem
 - Send to GitHub
 - Extending to other HTML elements. "/images/company_logo.jpg".img (could check file, size, etc.)
                                     "/pages/about_us.html".href

History
 - Pushed code to Git.
 - Created test Gem.
 - Added files to create Gem and reorganised the file structure.
 - Made dual_sub pass all the tests, and added the examples from .tr (translate) Ruby docs to the test.
 - More work on the "dynamic namespace clash resolver", in other words, tr and sub work in both classic and Taggart way.
 - Initial version of "dynamic namespace clash resolver" to fix issues with .tr
 - Added basic RSpec test.
 - Added namespacing for Strings and Arrays
 - Implemented arrays; ["Label", "Value"].td.tr.table and ["First", "Second", "Third"].li.ol
 - Tidied up things a bit.
 - Added a version of attributes ("Red".span(class: 'red'))
 - First version. Basic tags.

Feedback welcome!!
